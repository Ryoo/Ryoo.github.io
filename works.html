										<h3>Nanoscience and Materials</h3>
										<p class="justify">
											Chemistry is the study of matter, and how it interacts with surroundings or other matters.
											As a chemist, I learned about the properties of different molecules and their interactions with their surroundings.
											Some chemists are specialized in chemical-chemical interactions to produce a new desired chemical, 
											but I became more focused on the fundamental properties of the chemicals and the matter constructed from the chemicals.
											
											For my master's degree, I studied the fundamental properties of metal-containing nanomaterials orginating from subtle differences in their material structures.
											
											Now, my current work involves producing cost effective materials (carbon electrodes and polymer membranes) for their practical applications and designing practical routes to depolymerize polymer wastes.
										</p>

										<h3>Theories</h3>
										<p class="justify">
											To design and control the properties of new materials, it is extremely important to understand the chemical/physical theory behind the materials.
											Previously existing theories can be used to create a model material, by which then the model is compared to what is observed in the laboratory.
											Through comparison and testing, we can make understand the origin of the observed phenomena, or work to fill the gap in the underlying theory.
											While my current work does not involve the heavy theoratical side of the materials we produce, I've always been interested in the fundamental theories that govern the properties of the materials.

											<h3>Research in Civil Service</h3>
											<p class="justify"> 
												Before I pursue further education, my M.S. degree allowed me to work as a researcher to fulfill the mandatory military services.
												Located in Daejeon, my current work at <a href="#">Siontech Co., Ltd.</a> focuses on water purification and plastic recycling technologies.

											<h3>Master's Research</h3>
											<p class="justify">
												My master's thesis research was conducted under Dr. Millstone at the University of Pittsburgh. The <a href="#">Millstone Group</a> focuses on the properties of nanomaterials.
												Among numerous interesting nanomaterials, my master's research was focused on small gold nanoparticles and gold nanocrystals, 
												studying their syntheses, properties, and the theories behind them. I'm currently taking time off from the Ph.D program due to my civil service.

											<h3>Summer Research</h3>
											<p class="justify"> 
												During the summer after my sophomore year, I had a chance to work under Dr. Yaron at Carnegie Mellon University. 
												The <a href="#">Yaron Group</a> focuses on the theoretical description of the photophysics of conjugated polymers and other organic semiconductors.
												While I was lacking in my understanding of modern computational theories in chemistry, Dr. Yaron helped me to work on understanding and describing 
												electronic models in rather complicated systems using different calculation methods including density functional tight binding (DFTB) methods.
