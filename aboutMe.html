								<h3>About Myself</h3>
								<p class="justify"> 
                                    I was born in Daejeon, South Korea. Being a decent size city known for science and technology, Daejeon was a great place to grow my passion and interest in science. 
                                    Before graduating middle school, I wanted to pursue my passion for science by studying abroad in United States. 
                                    To me, the ability to speak fluent English is important both in learning the world outside of my own and conducting research with world-class researchers.
                                    With my parent's full support, I was able to live in many places in the U.S. including Utah, Connecticut and Pennylvania. During those times in the U.S., I was able to finish my Masters degree under the guidence of Dr. Millstone at the University of Pittsburgh.
                                </p>
								<p class="justify"> 
                                    As a Korean citizen, I am back home and just finished my mandatory military conscription. 
                                    Luckily, I was eligible to perform my military service as a technical research personnel with a Korean environmental company <a href="https://www.siontech.com/english">Siontech Co., Ltd.</a>
                                    Though this position still required me to follow many of the military restrictions and obligations as others, 
                                    it allowed me an opportunity to apply my knowledge of Chemistry and perform ongoing research.
                                    During this time, I have had the opportunity to develop and engineer new methods of purifying water and recycling PET waste. 
                                    I also wrote and submitted those same methods to the Korean patent office and multiple international patent offices. 
                                    Additionally, the strong Covid restrictions in Korea led me to take on some personal projects and online courses hours after work.
                                </p>

                                    During the time I was abroad, I was fortunate to encounter many brilliant people, diverse cultures, and fascinating body of thoughts.
                                    Now that I have fulfilled my mandatory service, I plan on returning to academia to get a phD in chemistry.
                                    Hopefully, I can learn more about the world and meet more great minds during my pursuit of higher education. 
                                   

                                    I am truly excited for my next chapter to begin and to explore new opportunities.

                                    Learning about different cultures, people, and new scientific discoveries are my passion.
                                    Hopefully one day, I can be part of those who lived to expand our knowledge and build better future.
                                    Just as I was inspired by those who came before me, I would love to inspire others.
