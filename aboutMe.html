								<h3>Introducing Myself</h3>
								<p> 
                                    I was born in Daejeon, South Korea. For those who are not from South Korea and not familiar with Dajeon, Dajeon is a city surrounded by mountains and it has many Korea's national science facilities.
                                    Having national science museum and other science/technology related places, Daejeon was a great place to grow my passion and interest in science. 
                                    At the end of my middle school, I wanted to study abroad in United States. I wanted to be able to speak English fluently, so that I can conduct research with the world-class researchers while learning about the other side of the world.
                                    It was not easy to convince my parents, but they had faith in me. 
                                    With my parents full support, I was able to live in many places and educations in U.S. including Utah, Connecticut and Pennylvania, where I was able to finish my Masters degree under guidence of Dr. Millstone in University of Pittsburgh.
                                </p>
								<p>As a Korean man, I'm currently back home serving my military conscription. 
                                    Fortunately, I was able to put in use of my education as an alternative civil sevice in lieu of physically training to be a foot soldier. 
                                    I am researching in a small-sized environmental company <a href="siontech.html">Siontech Co., Ltd.</a> 
                                    My work focuses on water purification technology, which I hope can be used to help those in need of clean water and also keep the envrionment healthy.
                                    Working as a researcher for my service, I get after work-time to myself with some restrictions.
                                    I like to spend those times working on different projects and learning new things.
                                    I also enjoy playing hockey and other sports, as well as playing video games.

                                </p>

                                <p> 
                                    While I was travelling and living in many places, I was fortunate to encounter many brilliant people, diverse cultures, and fascinating body of thoughts.
                                    I'm hoping that once I fulfill my service to my country, I get to countinue learn about the world and meet more great minds and hear their thoughts.
                                    That includes traveling around the world, live in differnt place, figuring out the meaning of life and what I want to do with mine. Or maybe just countinue with doing more scientific research to figure out about the world.
                                    Learning about different cultures, people, and new scientific diiscoveries are my passion, but I also believe the importance of education.

                                    To certain degree, both science and educations have become much easier to access, but the learning curve has gotten steeper with more things to learn in countless fields of science.

                                    Because of this, I think many people are distancinig themselves from the science - either being scared or dismissing the importance of the science.
                                    
                                    Knowing the importance of science to public as well as public to science, I really want to bridge the gap between the science and public through different means.

                                    I have some plans in my mind, but if you have any suggestions or wants to help, feel free to contact me.
                                </p>
