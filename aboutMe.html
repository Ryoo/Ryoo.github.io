								<h3>About Myself</h3>
								<p class="justify"> 
                                    I grew up in Daejeon, South Korea, a hub for science and technology. 
                                    My early fascination with the sciences flourished in this innovative environment, setting the lifelong interests in the world of sciences. 
                                    To me, the ability to speak fluent English is important both in expanding my worldview and collaborating with world-class researchers.
                                    Thanks to my parents' support, I traveled and lived in many places in the U.S. including Utah, Connecticut, and Pennylvania.
                                    Pursuing my dreams, I deeply immersed myself in the academic life at the University of Pittsburgh, ultimately completing my master's degree under <a href="https://jem210.weebly.com/">Professor Jill E. Millstone</a>.
                                    My focus in materials science not only developed my technical abilities but also broadened my cultural insights, greatly improving my teamwork in interdisciplinary and international research settings.
                                </p>
								<p class="justify"> 
                                    My commitment to scientific exploration led me back to Korea for military service, where I served in a unique capacity as a technical researcher at <a href="https://www.siontech.com/english">Siontech Co., Ltd.</a>
                                    This role allowed me to apply my expertise in chemistry to real-world challenges, leading to advancements in water purification and PET recycling. 
                                    My tenure here was marked by innovation and practical application of research, contributing to several patents and paving the way for sustainable environmental solutions.
                                    This journey has been more than a series of academic and professional milestones; it has been a holistic experience enriched by the people I've met and the diverse cultures I've been part of. 
                                    As I embark on the next phase of my career, I returned back to academic research at the University of Pennylvania. 
                                    Pursuing a PhD in Chemistry under the guidance of <a href="https://web.sas.upenn.edu/cbmurray/">Professor Chris B. Murray</a>, I am driven by a deep-seated curiosity to explore uncharted territories in science and a commitment to contribute meaningfully to the global scientific community.
