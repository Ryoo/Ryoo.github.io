								<h3>About Myself</h3>
								<p class="justify"> 
                                    I was born in Daejeon, South Korea. Being a decent size city known for science and technology, Daejeon was a great place to grow my passion and interest in science. 
                                    Before graduating middle school, I wanted to pursue my passion for science by studying abroad in United States. 
                                    To me, ability to speak fluent English is important both in learning the world outside of my own and conducting research with the world-class researchers.
                                    With my parents full support, I was able to live in many places in U.S. including Utah, Connecticut and Pennylvania. During those times in U.S., I was able to finish my Masters degree under guidence of Dr. Millstone in University of Pittsburgh.
                                </p>
								<p class="justify"> 
                                    As a male citizen of Korea, I'm currently back home serving my mandatory military conscription. 
                                    Fortunately, I was able to put in use of my education as an alternative civil sevice in lieu of physically training to be a foot soldier. 
                                    I am researching in an environmental company <a href="siontech.html">Siontech Co., Ltd.</a> 
                                    My work focuses on lab to pilot scale technologies involving water purification and plastic depolymerization.
                                    Working as a researcher for my service, I get after work-time to myself with some restrictions.
                                    I like to spend those times working on different projects and learning new things.
                                </p>
                                <h3><blockquote>It teaches us first by tutors and books, to learn that which is already known to others, and then by the light and methods which belong to science to learn for ourselves and for others; so making a fruitful return to man in the future for that which we have obtained from the men of the past.

                                <p class="justify"> 
                                    During the time I was abroad, I was fortunate to encounter many brilliant people, diverse cultures, and fascinating body of thoughts.
                                    I'm hoping that once I finish my mandatory service, I'll get to countinue learn more about the world by meeting more great minds.
                                    By that, I would love to travel around the world, live in differnt place, interact with countless  people from all types of background.

                                    Learning about different cultures, people, and new scientific discoveries are my passion.
                                    Hopefully one day, I can be part of those who lived to expand our knowledge and build better future.
                                    Just as I was inspired by those who came before me, I would love to inspire others.
