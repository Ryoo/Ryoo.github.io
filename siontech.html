								<h3>Water purification</h3>
								<p class="justify">
									Water, undeniably, is the lifeblood of our planet.
									Essential for a myriad of biological, industrial, and domestic purposes, it's increasingly becoming scarce. 
									The  <a href="https://www.unwater.org/water-facts/scarcity/">United Nations</a> and the <a href="http://pdf.wri.org/aqueduct_metadata_global.pdf">World Resources Institute</a> highlight a pressing crisis: water scarcity, exacerbated by urbanization, industrialization, and population growth. 
									This scarcity poses a significant challenge for humanity. <br><br>
									<b>Capacitive Deionization (CDI): </b>
									A revolutionary technology in water purification. 
									CDI operates through low-voltage charged porous electrodes in water, attracting solvated ions. 
									Reversing the charges releases these ions, allowing for repeated purification cycles. 
									Recent advancements, including ion-exchange membranes, have dramatically enhanced CDI's efficiency. 
									Its lower energy requirement and higher clean water recovery rate position CDI as a formidable alternative to traditional purification methods.
									<ul> <strong>My Contributions: </strong>
										<li>Developing materials that balance performance enhancement with cost-effectiveness.</li>
										<li>Innovating production lines for speed and affordability.</li>
									</ul>
								</p>

								<!-- <h3>Water purification</h3>
								<p class="justify">
									Water is one of the most, if not the most, important resources in the world. 
									Not to mention the biological functions requiring water, we need water for laboratory, agricultural, and industrial purposes as well as for household activities like doing laundry and taking showers. According to <a href="https://www.unwater.org/water-facts/scarcity/">UN</a> and <a href="http://pdf.wri.org/aqueduct_metadata_global.pdf">World Resources Institute</a>, many countries in the world are
									already suffering from water scarcity. As urbanization and industrialization continues with increasing population and better standards of living, the fresh, usable water shortage will be
									one of the major problems facing humanity. <br><br>
									<b>Capacitive Deionization (CDI): </b>
									When two porous inert electrodes in the water are charged with low voltage, the solvated ions in water start to adsorb onto the electrodes with the right charge.
									Once the charges on the electrodes are reversed, the adsorbed ions are released back into the water. 
									With the addition of ion-exchange membranes in the CDI system, recent development of CDI shows enhanced performances and a promising future as the next generation technology in water purification.
									Combined with the benefits of requiring less energy to operate and a higher clean water recovery rate, CDI seems to be a
									viable potential alternative to the current methods of water purification.
									<ul> <strong>My current work in CDI focuses on two <a class="phone-hide" style="color: black;">main</a> parts: </strong>
										<li>Material with enhanced performance and lower cost</li>
										<li>Cheaper and faster production lines</li>

								<h3>Plastic waste depolymerization</h3>
								<p class="justify">
									Since 1907, plastics have revolutionized our lives, permeating every aspect from electronics to packaging.
									However, the durability and ubiquity of plastics have led to an <a href="https://www.bpf.co.uk/plastipedia/applications/default.aspx">environmental crisis</a>, with massive amounts of waste <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.co.uk/10-shocking-facts-about-plastic">endangering ecosystems</a>. 
									Amidst this, scientists, including our team, are urgently addressing the issue, supported by evolving government policies.

									In particular I focused on depolymerizing polyethylene terephthalate (PET). By breaking down PET into its constituent monomers, we aim to transform plastic waste into reusable resources. This process is crucial for sustainable recycling and waste management.

									<ul> <strong>My Contributions: </strong>
										<li>Innovating in cost-effective and waste-reducing recycling methodologies.</li>
										<li>Enhancing the yield and purity of reusable monomers, aligning lab-scale efficiency with industrial-scale needs.</li>
									</ul>
								</p>

								<!-- <h3>Plastic waste depolymerization</h3>
								<p class="justify">
									Since the first mass production of synthetic plastics in 1907, plastics have drastically changed humankind. 
									In that short period of time, scientists developed a variety of plastics with a huge range of desirable properties. 
									Now plastics are found <a href="https://www.bpf.co.uk/plastipedia/applications/default.aspx">everywhere</a> in our daily lives, from electronics to packaging.
									Unfortunately, plastic's versatility and durability is now creating <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.co.uk/10-shocking-facts-about-plastic">huge problems</a> in the world. 
									Billions and trillions of tons of plastic waste are threatening our environments and ecosystems, and the pollution is only getting worse as we produce more plastics.

									Thankfully, many scientists and researchers are aware of all the havoc caused by plastic wastes and many are trying to fix the problem exacerbated in the last century.
									With many new government policies aiming to reduce plastic waste, we are also partaking in the reduction of single use plastic waste.
									We focus on depolymerizing polyethylene terephthalate (PET) to yield the constituent monomers. 
									By increasing the efficiency of lab-scale depolymerization to meet the needs of the real-world scale of recycling plants, we are hoping to achieve a sustainable future by reusing plastic waste.

									<ul> <strong>My current work in plastic waste focuses on two main parts: </strong>
										<li>New methods for reducing cost and waste in polymer recycling</li>
										<li>Increasing yield and purity of reusable monomers</li>
									</ul>
