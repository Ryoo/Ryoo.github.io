								<h3>Water purification</h3>
								<p>
									Water is one of the most, if not the most, important resources in the world. 
									Not to mention the biological functions requiring water, we need water for laboratory, agriculutal, and industrial purposes to household purposes like doing laundry and taking shower.
									Comparing to the needs, the proportion of the fresh water is only about 3% of total water on earth and if we consider that the large portion of the fresh water is composed of glaciers and groundwater, 
									the real portion of usable water from lake and rivers are limited about 0.01% of the total water on earth. 

									According to <a href="https://www.unwater.org/water-facts/scarcity/">UN</a> and <a href="http://pdf.wri.org/aqueduct_metadata_global.pdf">World Resources Institute</a>, many countries in the world are
									already suffering from the water scarcity. As the urbanization, industrialization countinues with increase population and better standards of living, this fresh, usable water shortage will be
									one of the major problems facing humanity. There are many methods, such as reverse osomis (RO) and ion exchange (IX), developed to process water, but there are also many other shortcoming from the methods.
									Therefore, newer and more environmentally friendly methods of water purification are highly desirable in order to overcome the challanges we are and will face in near future.

								<h3>Capacitative Deionization (CDI)</h3>
								<p>First concept of CDI was reported by <a href = "https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ba-1960-0027.ch020#">Blair and Murphy</a> in 1960s. 
								When two porous inert electrodes in the water was charged with low voltage, the solvated ions in water started to adsorbed into the electrodes with the right charge.
								Once the charges on the electrodes are reversed, the adsorbed ions are release back into the water. 
								This initial concept of CDI at the time was not able to compete with the other already developed water purification like R/O and IX.
								With countinuous developments on the technology in early 2000s, producing advanced CDI with enhanced performances, 
								such as membrane CDI (MCDI) <a href ="https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/9a/3a/8a/6b5d42e4de0494/US6709560.pdf">patented by Adelmann</a> in 2004, 
								CDI shows a promising future as the next generation technology in water purificaition. 
								Especially with the benefits of requiring less energy to operate and high clean water recovery rate, CDI seems to be 
								pontential alternatives to the current methods of water purification.
								</p>
								
								<p> <b>My current work in <a href ="#"> Siontech Co., Ltd.</a> focuses on two main parts:</b></p>
								<ul>
									<li><strong>Material with enhanced performance and lower the cost</strong></li>
									<ul>
										<li>Hybrid materials design for carbon based electrodes</li>
										<li>Efficient ion exchange membrane and membrane structures</li>
										<li>Specific ion selectivity for special purposes</li>
									</ul>
									<li><strong>Cheaper and faster production lines</strong></li>
									<ul>
										<li>Developing simple and efficient mass manufacturing line</li>
										<li>Designing products that are durable and user friendly</li>
									</ul>
								</ul>

								<h3>Implementing CDI on the real world</h3>
								<p>
									Being a more recent technology, CDI is yet more obscure than the previously mentioned methods of water purification.
									In order to compete with the other water purification methods, and to help people to be more aware to the scarcity of water in the world,
									it is educating the public about the CDI and water scarcity is important.
									We are also collaborating with others companies working in the countries with poor water resources in order to help the people in need the most.
