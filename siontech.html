								<h3>Water purification</h3>
								<p>
									Water is one of the most, if not the most, important resources in the world. 
									Not to mention the biological functions requiring water, we need water for laboratory, agriculutal, and industrial purposes to household purposes like doing laundry and taking shower. According to <a href="https://www.unwater.org/water-facts/scarcity/">UN</a> and <a href="http://pdf.wri.org/aqueduct_metadata_global.pdf">World Resources Institute</a>, many countries in the world are
									already suffering from the water scarcity. As the urbanization, industrialization countinues with increase population and better standards of living, the fresh, usable water shortage will be
									one of the major problems facing humanity. <br><br>
									<b>Capacitative Deionization (CDI): </b>
									When two porous inert electrodes in the water was charged with low voltage, the solvated ions in water started to adsorbed into the electrodes with the right charge.
									Once the charges on the electrodes are reversed, the adsorbed ions are release back into the water. 
									With the addition of ion-exchange membrane in the CDI system, recent development of CDI shows enhanced performances and promising future as the next generation technology in water purificaition.
									Especially with the benefits of requiring less energy to operate and high clean water recovery rate, CDI seems to be 
									pontential alternatives to the current methods of water purification.
									<ul> <strong>My current work in CDI focuses on two <a class="phone-hide" style="color: black;">main</a> parts: </strong>
										<li>Material with enhanced performance and lower the cost</li>
										<li>Cheaper and faster production lines</li>
									</ul>

								<h3>Plastic waste depolymerization</h3>
								<p>
									Since the first mass production of synthetic plastics in 1907, plastics has drastically changed the humanity. 
									In that short period of time, scientists developed variety of plastics with huge range of desireable properties. 
									And now plastics are found in <a href="https://www.bpf.co.uk/plastipedia/applications/default.aspx">everywhere</a> in our everyday uses, from electronics to packagings.
									Unfortunately, plastics' versatility and durability is now creating <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.co.uk/10-shocking-facts-about-plastic">huge problems</a> in the world. 
									Billions and trillions tons of plastics waste are treatening our environments, and the pollution is only getting worse as we produce more plastics.

									Thankfully, many people are aware of all the havoc caused by plastic wastes and many are trying to fix the problem exacerbated in the last centurty.
									With many new government policies aiming to reduce plastic wastes, we are also partaking in reducing single use plastic wastes.
									We focus on depolymerizing PET (Polyethylene Terephthalate) to yield the constituent monomers. 
									By increasing the efficiecy of lab-scale depolymerization to real-world scale recycle plant, we are hoping to reuse plastic waste.

									<ul> <strong>My current work in Plastic waste focuses on two main parts: </strong>
										<li>New methods for reducing cost and waste in polymer recycling</li>
										<li>Increase yield and purity of reusable monomers</li>
									</ul>

								<h3>Future Outlook</h3>
								<p>
									Both fresh water scarcity and abundance of plastic waste are relevent issues we face today. 
									For sustainable future, we focus on producing new materials and methods to face those issues. 
									In the large-scale environments, I'm learning as I apply those knowledges I gathered in the lab.
