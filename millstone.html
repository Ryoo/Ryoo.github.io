								<h3>Very small Nanoparticles</h3>

										The word 'nano' originates from ancient greek word 'nanos,' meaning 'dwarf.' It is a prefix to describe something extremely small, and the unit nanometer is billion times smaller than the meter stick.
										Therefore nanoparticles are particle that have at least one dimensions lesser than 100 nm. My work in Millstone group focused on much smaller nanoparticles: they are pseudospherical nanoparticles that are smaller than 20nm, especially in less than 5 nm in all dimensions. 
										In this small dimensions, materials start to behave different than they would behave in bulk systems. 
										One of the most famous example of the many unique nanomaterial properties is localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR).
										This is when the nanoparticle is smaller than the wavelength of the light, thus electron clouds in the nanoparticle is oscillatinig with the incoming lights, producing specific colors back.
										The oscillation of the electron clouds can be controlled by using different wavelengths of light, but also due to the size and shape of the nanoparticles.
										In my work, we focuse on the surface structures of the nanoparticles and how the change in the surface translate to overall nanomaterial properties.

										<h3>Nanocrystals with various surface properties</h3>
										My majority of works were focused on the gold nanocrystals. The nanocrystals are part of the nanoparticles, but they have defined crystal structures. 
										They can be collected by multiple of purifications and crystalization to collect the pure nanoparticles.
										Having the defined structure they are much easier make more definitive connection between observation and theory. 
										My work focused on synthesizing nanocrystals with 11 gold core (undecanoic gold clusters) and 13 gold core (icosahedral gold clusters) with varying ligands. 
										These gold cores were stablized with L-type ligands (pnictides) and X-type ligands (halogens). 
										From finding their crystal structures to measuring their absorption and emission properties, the similarities and differences were studied by making subtle changes on their surface.

								<h3>Modeling of the Nanocrystals</h3>
								<p>
								With known crystal structure, the coordinates of each atom can be used to build a computational models. 
								The computational models are used to calculate electronic structures from existing theories. 
								By comparing the electronic structures of same nanocrystals with differnte surface ligands, 
								we can observe how surface ligands can perturb the super atomic orbitals of the gold core.

								Additionally, the experimental observables can be compared to the electronic structures of the same nanocrystal models to inform the origin of the phenomena that is observed.
								Mild influences of the surface ligands on the properties of the nanocrystals, such as absorptions and kjfoawjeoiajf, are describe by similarities of the electronic structures. 
								On the other hand, certain new properties heavily influenced by the surface ligands, like emission strength and stabilities, are suggested by the differences of the electronic structures.
								This work is aimed to understand the ligand-nanomaterial interactions, and help designing of new generation nanomaterials.
